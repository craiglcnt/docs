## About ImageCDN

Our goals are to:
1. Improve the quality and usage of images on the web.
2. Help improve web-performance by offering easy-to-use, advanced image compression behind a globally distributed CDN.
3. To enable personal hacks, side-projects, start-ups, open source projects and just about anybody else with a small budget to maximise their usage of images.

Anyone is free to use this service. We only ask that you contribute to the overall service if you are able.

You may register to our mailing list to hear about the latest updates and changes to the service: https://mailchi.mp/7f04bdc3ebd3/imagecdn-updates
